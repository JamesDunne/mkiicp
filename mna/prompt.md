Let's take the following SPICE net list and simulate it in C++ as a realtime digital audio filter. Let's break up the whole circuit into 9 independent segments divided at each tube stage and at each RC network in between as well as the passive tone stack. Combine the first tube stage V1A with the tone stack in one segment.

Use MNA and bilinear transform to solve each circuit segment independently in its own C++ class. Use the provided 12AX7 model to simulate the tube response.

Be sure to account for every resistor and capacitor present in the SPICE net list as they are all very important for proper gain staging between tube stages as well as frequency response and distortion behavior.

Recommend building a template header MNASolver templated on the number of unknowns and implementing each circuit segment to extend that template class.
